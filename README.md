# walmart_sales_etl_project

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to design and implement a complete data pipeline and business analysis workflow on Walmart sales data. This project aims to transform raw sales data into actionable business insights through a systematic Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process followed by in-depth analysis and visualization.

## The key goals include:

Extract: Acquire raw Walmart sales data from Kaggle, which contains detailed transactional information including store performance, product categories, and sales figures.

Transform: Perform extensive data cleaning and preprocessing using Python and Pandas to handle missing values, correct data types, remove inconsistencies, and create new derived features to enrich the dataset for analysis.

Load: Upload and store the cleaned dataset into a MySQL database server to enable efficient querying and further analysis using SQL.

Analyze: Develop and execute multiple SQL queries to explore sales trends, identify top-performing stores and products, analyze seasonal patterns, and uncover potential areas for business improvement.

Visualize: Create comprehensive and interactive dashboards in Power BI to effectively communicate key insights to stakeholders, supporting data-driven decision making.
